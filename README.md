# penalized_survRRR

This repository contains an illustration of how to use the R-function [`pen.survrrr`](survRRR_functions.R), meant to penalized reduced rank regression model for survival data (penalized survRRR). The function is illustrated on a simulated example dataset. The code to create the simulated dataset can be found [here](create_simulated_dataset.md). The code to fit the model can be found [here](example_analysis.md).
